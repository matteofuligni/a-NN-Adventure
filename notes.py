# Rewards
# Food -> +10
# Obstacle -> -10

# States (with a vision of only 1 block, 0 and 1 values) 
# where 1 is the obtable or the food and 0 is the empty space

# Just thinking that if I want to estend the vision to 2 blocks, I will have 2^6 = 64 states because every state 
# would be a vector of 2 elements (0 or 1) for each of the 6 blocks.
